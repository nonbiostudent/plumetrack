Quickstart - Graphical User Interface
=====================================


.. note::

  The realtime display of the motion field requires the recomputation of the motion field each time a parameter is changed. On old hardware, or for very large images this may be rather slow, making the program unresponsive. Increasing the downsizing factor will help to improve performance - but keep in mind that this will also affect the accuracy of the plotted motion field.
