plumetrack is a `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ program for computing sulphur dioxide fluxes from SO2 camera data. It does *not* perform image calibration into SO2 column amounts. Instead it uses optical flow to calculate the velocity field between pre-calibrated images and allows integrations to be performed across arbitrary paths in the images to compute fluxes.

It is designed with volcanic monitoring in mind and can perform both real-time and batch processing of images.
