"""
The dir_iter module provides an iterator class for iterating through the files
in a directory structure. In its most simple form it can be used to list 
the files in a directory (much like os.listdir()). However, it can also be used
to list files in realtime as they are created (using the watcher module).

The following code shows how the dir_iter module can be used to print the names
of any new files created in a directory:

    from _plumetrack import dir_iter
    
    for filename in dir_iter.DirFileIter("my_directory", realtime=True):
        print filename

        * pattern - Unix "glob" type pattern to match for filenames.
