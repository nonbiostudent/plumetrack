# Plumetrack SO2 flux calculator

## Overview
The plumetrack program is designed to be the final component in UV camera processing toolchains. Given a set of calibrated UV images, it uses the Farneback optical-flow algorithm to compute the 2D velocity field of the plume and uses this to calculate the SO2 flux across a user defined contour. It can be used to batch process existing image sets or to compute fluxes in realtime.
